Building

Building requires the Qt cross platform toolkit: http://qt.nokia.com/. Recommended Qt version is 4.7.2. The program has been tested to successfully build with Visual Studio 2008 on Windows, Qt Creator SDK 2.1.0 on Mac OS X and the default toolchain on Ubuntu 10.10. See build.bat/build.sh to get started. Video processing is only available on Mac OS X and Windows and requires Apple QuickTime, http://www.apple.com/quicktime. The Apple QuickTime SDK for Windows can be downloaded here: http://developer.apple.com/quicktime.
